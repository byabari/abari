          Hi, my name is Abari Abbassi. I was born in Amsterdam, gew up between
          Morocco and Amsterdam, studied Computer Science in Paris, and did an
          exchange semester in Japan.

          I've worked with several sturtups. Among them is Hubs. Hubs is an
          on-demand manufacturing marketplace. I joined Hubs at the peak of
          their rapid growth stage. During my time there, the company was
          acquired for $280 million and was rebranded from 3D Hubs to Hubs.
        </p>

          Following that, I joined Practice. Practice is a CRM-like product for
          coaches and consultants. I joined Practice right after their seed
          round, led by a16z, and helped build some of the core parts of the
          product.

          Apart from my computer work, I also have a passion for photography.
