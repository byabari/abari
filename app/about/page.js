          Hi, my name is Abari Abbassi. I was born in Amsterdam and moved to
          Morocco at the age of 10. I studied Computer Science in Paris and did
          an exchange semester in Japan. During my time at university, I worked
          at a different startup every summer.

          After my final semester in Japan, I joined Hubs, an Amsterdam-based
          scale-up, during its rapid growth phase. Hubs is an on-demand
          manufacturing marketplace with manufacturing partners around the
          world. I mainly worked on solving the problem of shipping delays.
          During my time there, the company was acquired for $280 million and
          rebranded from 3D Hubs to Hubs.

          Following that, I moved from Amsterdam to Tangier, Morocco, and joined
          the fully remote startup, Practice, after their seed round led by
          a16z. Practice is an all-in-one SaaS product for client-based
          businesses, such as coaches and consultants. As a full-stack
          developer, I worked on several core features, including the home
          dashboard, payments, onboarding flows, email notifications, etc.

          Apart from my computer work, I'm also passionate about photography.

          Hotel.

          My lifestyle also includes regular biking and swimming. One of the
          driving factors behind my move to Tangier was the opportunity to
          pursue these hobbies year-round. Back in my teenage years, I competed
          in numerous cycling races and achieved a notable 7th place at the
          Moroccan cycling championships. These days, I continue to take part in
          the occasional triathlon or cycling race every few months.
