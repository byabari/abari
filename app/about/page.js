          Hi, my name is Abari Abbassi. I was born in Amsterdam. I gew up
          between Morocco and Amsterdam, studied Computer Science in Paris, and
          did an exchange semester in Japan.

          I have worked with several sturtups. Among them is Hubs. Hubs is an
          on-demand manufacturing marketplace. I joined Hubs at the peak of
          their rapid growth stage. I mainly worked on solving the problem of
          shipping delays. During my time there, the company was acquired for
          $280 million and was rebranded from 3D Hubs to Hubs.

          Following that, I joined Practice. Practice is an CRM-like product for
          coaches and consultants. I joined Practice right after their seed
          round, led by a16z, and helped build some of the core parts of the
          product.
